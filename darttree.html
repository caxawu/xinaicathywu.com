      <center>DartTree is a redesign of the Dartmouth Alumni Career Network that connects people based on interests both inside and outside of the professional realm.
        It also allows students to connect more easily and more comfortably with alumni by making profiles a better reflection of who a person is.

          Before we started designing, we had to clarify some assumptions. We all projected that finance and consulting paths were the most popular
          and assumed that this sector would make up about half of the graduating student population. To find the real numbers, we sorted through
          statistics released by Dartmouth and found Dartmouth's 2018 Cap & Gown Survey.
          <br><br>

          <br><br><br>
          From the data that this survey provided, it became rather clear what the distribution of career paths were. In the words of Mindy Kaling:

          <br><br>

          We found that <span style="color: #326B45"><b>students intending to get a job in finance or consulting made up 47% of the graduating population.</b></span> However, we also found that the next most popular career
          path was in tech with 16% of students. Therefore, we decided that tech jobs would also be considered "on the beaten path."

          This timeline summarized the demographic of people we interviewed as well as their experiences with Dartmouth's Center for Professional Development (CPD).
          <span style="color: #326B45"><b>Almost all the interviewees who were "on the beaten path" made use of the CPD while almost all of those who were
            "off the beaten path" did not. </b></span>
            <br><br>
            We further looked at quotes from the interviewees to see why this pattern existed.

            This was the quote that caught our attention. We realized that this sentiment was echoed by many interviewees.

                  These aspects allow the alum's profile to have a more personal feel than the existing Dartmouth Alumni Career Networks catalogue-style database. DartTree would also require
                  a profile picture and inputting interests so that students immediately feel a more personal connection to the alum.

                    <h5><b> Pet Peeves & Networking Preferences </b></h5>
                    Another barrier students face when reaching out to alumni is the fear of "cold-calling." Students agonize over sending the perfect email&mdash;attempting to strike the perfect balance between
                    professionalism and sounding human. By allowing alumni to add their pet peeves and networking preferences, we hope to reduce friction in reaching out to someone for the first time.
