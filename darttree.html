    <center>DartTree is a redesign of the Dartmouth Alumni Career Network that connects people based on interests both inside and outside of the professional realm.
      It also allows students to connect more easily and more comfortably with alumni by making profiles a better reflection of who a person is.

        To tackle this challenge, my team first set out to understand <span style="color: #326B45"><b>the scope of this task and specifically what
          it means for a career to be "off the beaten path."</b></span>
        </div>

        <div class = "column-center">
          <br><br>
          This meant that before we started designing, we had to clarify some assumptions. We all assumed that finance and consulting career paths were the most popular
          and that this sector would make up about half of the graduating student population. Instead of proceeding with our assumptions though, we wanted to proceed with real data.
          So, we sorted through statistics released by Dartmouth and found Dartmouth's 2018 Cap & Gown Survey.
          <br><br>

          <img src = "assets\images\projects\capgown.jpg" align = "left" width ="100%">
        </div>
        <div class = "column-center">
          <br><br><br>
          From the data that this survey provided, it became rather clear what the distribution of career paths were. In the words of Mindy Kaling:
          <br><br>

          <br><br>

          We found that <span style="color: #326B45"><b>students intending to get a job in finance or consulting made up 47% of the graduating student population.</b></span>
          However, we also found that the data also showed that 16% of the graduating population are going into the tech industry. Because this was a significant number of students,
          we decided that tech jobs would also be considered "on the beaten path."

          In order to gain a variety of perspectives, we conducted interviews to gain insights into how students were currently using resources to help them pursue their interests
          and careers.<br><br>
          We interviewed a total of <b><span style="color: #326B45">20 interviews </b></span>that covered:

          <h3><SUP>&nbsp;</SUP>The analysis</h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "right-two-third">
          During our interviews, we asked our interviewees about their general experiences with finding a career path. We also asked them about their experiences with Dartmouth's Center for
          Professional Development, or the CPD, as it is Dartmouth's primary resource for career help. We consolidated our data and pulled out insights that would help inform our designs.
        </div>
        <div class = "column-center">
          <br><br>
          <img src = "assets\images\projects\darttree-brainstorm2.png" align = "left" width ="100%">
        </div>
        <div class = "column-center">
          <br><br>
          <img src = "assets\images\projects\darttree-img1.png" align = "left" width ="100%">
        </div>
        <div class = "column-center">
          <br>
          This timeline helped us visualize our interviewees' experiences with CPD in terms of their year and if they were on or off "the beaten path."
          We found that though students' years didn't matter much, <span style="color: #326B45"><b>almost all the interviewees who were "on the beaten path" made use of the CPD
            while almost all of those who were "off the beaten path" did not. </b></span>
            <br><br><br>
            To find out why this pattern existed, we looked at quotes from the interviewees:
            <br><br>
          </div>
          <div class = "column-center">
            <img src = "assets\images\projects\darttree-img2.png" align = "left" width ="100%">
          </div>
          <div class = "column-center">
            <br>
            Of the students who were considered "off the beaten path, two quotes (in the green) especially stood out to us." The sentiment that
            "The alumni network is so diverse, but the CPD offerings just aren't." was echoed by many interviewees.
            Similarly, there was a general view that the CPD was only helpful to those going into finance or consulting.
            These views were largely due to the fact that <span style="color: #326B45"><b>students "off the beaten path" felt like the CPD didn't know how to help or have the resources to help&mdash;as the CPD
              does not have as many connections to more niche career paths.</b></span>
              Another finding was that interviewees who were on <span style="color: #326B45"><b>sports teams had a strong support group </b></span>from both classmates
              and from alumni as they had a shared common interest.
              <br><br>
              <div class = "indent">
                <h4><span style="color: #326B45"><b>&#x2B21; Insight:</b> Students "off the beaten path" found alumni to be the most helpful.</span></h4>
                <h4><span style="color: #326B45"><b>&#x2B21; Insight:</b> Students had success in connecting with people of similar interests.</span></h4>
              </div>
              <br><br>
              To summarize these findings, we found that what students "on the beaten path" and athletes had (and what students "off the beaten path" lacked)
              was <span style="color: #326B45"><b>support&mdash;specifically the support from others with similar interests and/or on similar paths.</b></span>

                  Zooming in on one alum reveals more information. DartTree provides the alum's contact information, his/her employment history, and other information such as a personal website.
                  These aspects allow the alum's profile to have a more personal feel than the existing Dartmouth Alumni Career Networks catalogue-style database. DartTree would also require
                  a profile picture and inputting interests so that students immediately feel a more personal connection to the alum.

                  When we talked to the assistant director of the Center for Professional Development, she told us that <b><span style="color: #326B45">the Hanover Inn has an alumni board that displays all alumni who are on campus each
                    week.</span></b> Most students are unaware of this and the board is in a location where students rarely pass by. <b><span style="color: #326B45">As part of DartTree, we want to digitize the board for easier access.</span></b>
                    <br><br>
                    One page in DartTree would have all the alumni who are on campus.

                    Each alum would also have a bell tower icon next to their profile picture that lights up when he/she is on campus.

                    <h5><b> Pet Peeves & Networking Preferences </b></h5>
                    Another barrier students face when reaching out to alumni is the fear of "cold-calling." Students agonize over sending the perfect email&mdash;attempting to strike the perfect balance between
                    professionalism and sounding human. By allowing alumni to add their pet peeves and networking preferences, we hope to reduce friction in reaching out to someone for the first time.
