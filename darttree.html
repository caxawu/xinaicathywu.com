        <h3><b>The prompt</b></h3>
        Use the design process to enable students to prepare for and pursue careers "off the beaten path."
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>The research</b></h3>
        To tackle this challenge my team first set out to understand what "off the beaten path" careers were. In our research,
        we found Dartmouth's 2018 Cap & Gown Survey.
      </div>
      <div class = "column">
        <img src = "assets\images\projects\tree1.jpg" align = "right" width="90%">

        <img src = "assets\images\projects\capgown.jpg" align = "left" width ="80%">
      </div>
      From this data that this survey provided, it became rather clear what the distribution of career paths were. In the
      words of Mindy Kaling:
      <br><br>
      <iframe width="1204" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSMczrG0Vqs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <br><br>
      But, besides those going into finance, a substantial number of students are also entering the tech sector. So, we
      focused on the 37% of students who fell under the "other category." We defined this group as the "off-pathers" and
      focused on them as our user group.
      <br><br>
      <h3><b>The problem</b></h3>
      Because so many Dartmouth graduates go into either finance and tech, many resources exist for them. They have excellent
      support from the Center for Professional Development (CPD) on campus and a strong alumni network. However, "off-pathers"
      have a lack of support and have to navigate the professional world by themselves.
      <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>To enable students off-the-beaten-path
        to better prepare for and pursue their careers, they need to be able to have greater exposure to
        their field of interest.</span></b>
      </div>

    <div class = "row">
      <h3><b>Our answer</b></h3>
      When we synthesized information from interviewing students pursuing off-the-beaten-path careers, we found that this group
      found alumni to be the most helpful. So, we focused on improving this connection. <b>Students needed easier means of connecting
        with alumni who can help develop their interests and provide guidance in their professional pursuits.</b>
        Specifically, we focused on increasing accessibility and decreasing intimidation in regard to reaching out to alumni.
        <br><br>
        Our proposed solution is DartTree&mdash;an interest-based networking platform that connects alumni and students
        through information that cannot be found on LinkedIn or the Dartmouth Alumni Career Network.
        DartTree is a redesign of the Dartmouth Alumni Career Network (ACN). Because it is interest-based, students and
        alumni can curate more intimate connections based on interests outside the professional realm&mdash;allowing
        students to reach out before they begin looking for a job.
        <br>
        <br><h3><b>How it works</b></h3>
        Students first put their interests into the platform. They are free to add or remove them as their interests grow
        during their time at Dartmouth. These seedlings of interest grow into their own personal DartTree.
        <div class = "column-galleryfull">
          <img src = "assets\images\projects\seeds.jpg" align = "left" width ="100%">
          <br>
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class = "row">
    <br>Each branch of the DartTree is a different interest. A number corresponds to each branch that indicates the
        number of alumni in the system with the same interest.
        <div class = "column-galleryfull">
          <br>
          <img src = "assets\images\projects\tree.jpg" align = "left" width ="100%">
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class = "row">
        <br>Clicking on a branch allows the student to access the alumni who share a similar interest.
        <div class = "column-galleryfull">
          <br>
          <img src = "assets\images\projects\branches.jpg" align = "left" width ="100%">
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class = "row">
        <br>Clicking on an alum gives the student more information. DartTree provides the alum's contact information, their
        employment history, and other information such as a personal website. Most importantly, alumni are
        required to provide a profile picture. These elements give each alum's profile
        more of a personal feel rather than the existing ACN's catalogue-style database.

    <div class = "row">
        <br><h3><b>Features</b></h3>
        <br>
        <b><i>Centralization</i></b>
        <br>One big problem with existing resources that is many students cannot locate them. Because they are so hard to find,
        some students don't even know that they exist. One simple solution would be to link Dartmouth's career site (Dartboard)
        on the student gateway page (Darthub) so that students have a centralized entry point to any resource they
        might need.
        <div class = "column-galleryfull">
          <img src = "assets\images\projects\central.jpg" align = "left" width ="100%">
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class = "row">
      <br>
        <b><i>Alumni on campus</i></b>
        <br>When we talked to the assistant director of the Center for Professional Develpment she told us that the Hanover Inn
        has an alumni board that displays all alumni that are on campus each day/week. Most students are unaware of this and
        the board itself is out of the way from where students would ordinarily venture. So, we thought to digitize this board
        for easier access. If an alum was on campus, the tower icon next to their name would light up, allowing students the
        chance to connect with them in person.

    <div class = "row">
      <br>
        <b><i>Pet peeves and networking preferences</i></b>
        <br>Another barrier students face when reaching out to alumni is the fear of "cold-calling." Students agonize over sending
        the perfect email&mdash;attempting to strike the perfect balance between professionalism and sounding human. By allowng
        alumni to add their pet peeves and networking preferences, we hope to reduce friction in reaching out to someone for
        the first time.
