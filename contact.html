      <h3><b>What we chose</b></h3>
      My team chose to focus on learning and began by researching existing trends and technologies.
      After multiple mind maps and interviews with the
      Student Accessibility Office we targeted several pain points
      and began brainstorming way in which we could improve them.
      <br><br>
      <h3><b>The problem</b></h3>
      We thought about how we might more easily and more seamlessly connect with people who speak a different language.
      <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>Ultimately, we set our sights on how individuals who does not speak
        American Sign Language need to communicate with hearing impaired individuals in order to
        form emotional connections.</span></b>

        We envisioned a product that takes contact lenses to the next level. With translating technologies built in,
        it provides real-time translations&mdash;allowing people who do not speak the same language to
        communicate seamlessly. In today's world where technology is becoming more and more prominent,
        we wanted to use technology to bring people together and foster connection.
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>Future uses and next steps</b></h3>
        <br>
        <b><i>Foreign countries</i></b>
        <br>Besides helping those who do not know sign language, this same technology can be used as a faster version of Google Translate,
        allowing people to feel more comfortable when travelling. This can help people feel less overwhelmed and safer in
        an unfamiliar location.
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Classrooms</i></b>
        <br>The technology would have applications in the classroom as well. Students with hearing disabilities and students
        sitting in the back of a big lecture hall could see what the professor is saying without distractions from other students.
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Loud environments</i></b>
        <br>People could better communicate with their friends at concerts and other noisy environments without having to shout. This contributes to people
        staying safe and aware.
