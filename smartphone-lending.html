        <br><h3><b>The problem</b></h3>
        This study was centered around exploring how people share technology and design for this in a way that promotes the sharing of technology. In the current state of smartphone usage, most people are either unwilling or uncomfortable with their devices in someone else’s hands. Since people are generally nice, they allow others to borrow their phone even though they are worried about sensitive materials on their phone among with many other concerns.

      <h3><b>The user</b></h3>
      Smartphone owners who want to help others by lending their phones, but are uncomfortable with the security of their phone in the borrower’s hands.
      <br>
      <h3><br><b>Our answer</b></h3>
      A smartphone-lending app that “locks” the phone in certain preset modes (strangers mode, friends mode, etc). Once a mode is turned on, the phone essentially runs a different launcher (similar to how Android devices can run different launchers). This mode restricts access of the phone to certain apps until the owner of the phone unlocks their phone using their typically unlocking method (fingerprint, faceID, etc). This app could paired with other smart devices such as smartwatches to allow for quick launching of the modes and for quickly granting permission overrides within modes.
      <br>
      <h3><br><b>The details</b></h3>

      <br><i><b>Presets</i></b>
      <br>The app comes preloaded with four preset modes: family, friends, acquaintances, and strangers. Users can change the presets or add their own according to their own preferences of how restrictive they want each mode to be.

      </div>
    </div>


    <div class = "row">
      <b><i>Security options</i></b>
      <br>Within each mode, the user can choose which apps they wish to grant/restrict access to. Each app can be configured to have one of three security options.
      <br>1. <b><span style="color: #148f9f">Hide app</span></b>: The app is not present
      <br>2. <b><span style="color: #148f9f">Dummy app</span></b>: The app is present, but when clicked on, shows a network connectivity error or another similar error
      <br>3. <b><span style="color: #148f9f">Privacy lock</span></b>: The app is functional, but has several features restricted

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "row">
      <b><i>Launch options</i></b>
      <br>The user can choose how they want to launch their modes.
      <br>   Fingerprint scanner: Using the scanner on the back of their phone allows for a total of 9 max presets (with the 10th finger to unlock the phone normally).
      <br>   Smartwatch: Clicking our app icon and using the side dial to scroll through presets allows for any number of presets.
      <br>   Settings menu: The pulldown settings menu can also be configured to an icon for each preset mode the user wants to set.
      <br>
      <br><b><i>Granting access</i></b>
      <br>As important as restricting access is granting it. Say a borrower needed a phone to call someone, but realized that they did not have the person’s contact information. The borrower tries to access Facebook messenger, but is denied access. We wanted to decrease the awkwardness of the borrower handing the phone back to the owner, the owner granting access to Facebook, and handing it back to the borrower. To target this problem, quick access apps can be configured in the app. Users can add any apps that they may want to grant access to depending on the situation. This function is most beneficial with a smartwatch. When the situation arises, users can click the quick access icon on the smartwatch and use the side dial to scroll through their quick access apps to allow a certain function.
      <br>
      <br><h3><i>Wouldn’t people get offended if they had restricted access?</i></h3>
      Through our research we found that people only ask to borrow someone’s phone if they have a pressing matter. Thus, their need for a phone would greatly outweigh any offense they might take from having restricted access. Further, the owner could easily explain than they use the same mode when lending to anyone (whether that is true or not!)
      <br>
      <br><h3><b>Bonus features</b></h3>
      Another big reason people don’t lend their phones is due to concerns of theft. That is why we have an “others security” section that can be toggled on or off for each mode. If the phone is on a mode with this toggled on, the phone’s accelerometer turns on. If it detects running, it blares an alarm and locks the sim card tray so the phone remains traceable.
