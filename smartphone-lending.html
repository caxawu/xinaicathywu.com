      <h3>Smartphone Lending is a research project centered around exploring how people share technology. Because phones contain so much
        personal information, people are uncomfortable with lending their phone to others. So, I prototyped a security app that allows people to
        quickly and discreetly "lock" their phone in modes with restricted access before letting someone borrow it.</h3>

          As a project in the XDiscovery HCI lab, the Smartphone Lending project was focused on how human-to-human connection could be facilitated by technology. Specifically, we were interested in the moment of interaction when

                  <div class = "section-text">
                    With the guidelines in mind, we thought about how to create a solution to facilitate easier phone lending/borrowing interactions. To target all three guidelines, we proposed an app where
                    <span class="highlight" id = "lending">users could customize profiles with varying levels of restrictions that could be launched
                      <span class = "semibold">quickly and discreetly</span> so that they could <span class = "semibold">feel safer</span> when sharing their phones.</span>

                        <div class = "half-line-spacing">
                          <span class = "semibold">Smartwatch-enabled:</span> The idea behind this feature is to allow the owner of the phone to essentially “keep tabs” on what a borrower is doing on their phone.
                          The smartwatch screen could display exactly what the borrower is seeing and could allow the owner to remotely lock certain apps or lock the entire phone. This feature also highlights <span class = "semibold">customizability</span>
                          as users can change the level of restriction on their phone as someone is using it.

                        <div class = "half-line-spacing">
                          <span class = "semibold">Fingerprint scanner:</span> Many smartphones have a fingerprint scanner and allow for multiple prints to be saved. Most people only use a few fingers to unlock their phones—so, we decided to use this
                          to our advantage. This feature proposes using the fingerprint scanner to launch the profiles that users have created. By using “uncommon” fingers like the fourth finger or the pinky, users can
                          <span class = "semibold">quickly and inconspicuously</span> launch a mode without the awkwardness of a borrower ever realizing that they have restricted access.

                          <span class = "semibold">Hardware protection:</span> Because one of the top concerns in phone-lending experiences is the fear of <span class = "semibold">theft,</span> we decided to implement a hardware protection element.
                          With this element on, if the phone’s accelerometer detects running (oh no a thief!), the phone would activate an alarm alerting everyone nearby. (“This person is holding a stolen phone! Stop them!”) In addition, this trigger
                          could also lock the sim card tray—preventing the thief from rendering the phone untraceable.

But, rather than just leaving the project with the research and proposed solutions, I wanted to use the research to actually build a solution.</span>
                So, I ventured on as a one-person team. But, before jumping into design, I wanted to define some things more formally to guide me through the rest of the design process.

                <div class = "category-title">The user</div>
                During the research phase, we all had a general idea of who the user was. But, rather than just running with a rather vague definition of “smartphone owners in a phone-lending situation,” I wanted a better sense of exactly who I would be designing for. Looking back on the research, I found a trend where many people are unwilling or uncomfortable with their device in someone else’s hands. However, people are generally nice (as least true for the people we interviewed). Because of that, they were willing to let others borrow their phone despite their discomfort in order to avoid confrontations and not say no.
                <br><br><br>
                <div class = "quote-block">
                  <span class = "semibold">So, I formally defined users as:</span> Smartphone owner who are uncomfortable with allowing others full access of their phone, but are too nice to say no.

                <br>
                <div class = "category-title">The problem</div>
                I wanted to better define the problem as well. Pinpointing the user helped me to pull out the main problem that I would be tackling: helping a phone-lender feel more comfortable with their device in someone else’s hands.

                Now that I had a clearly defined direction, I could think more critically about the solution. The proposed solution from our research phase (an app that allows users to customize profiles with varying levels of restrictions) was a great
                starting point—my research team and I had decided on it it during a ideation session towards the end of our research. Because the proposed solution was guided by research, I decided to run with it. I kept the core functionalities and
                features and decided to build onto the basic structure. So, I set about fleshing out the details of how a user might interact with this app.
                <br><br><br>

                  <img src = "assets\images\projects\lending\ideation4.png" width = 48% height= 48%>
                </div>
                <div class = "category-title">Conclusions and realizations</div>
                After thinking more critically about this app, I realized that it was really easy to make the app overly complicated with features and customizations.
                <span class="highlight" id = "lending">I knew that most of all, I wanted to focus on create an experience where the interaction between the user and the app was simple and intuitive.</span>
                Guided by this thought, I split the app into the three most important components:
                <br><br><br>
                <div class = "bar-section">
                  <div class = "bar-section-title"><span class = "semibold">Presets</span></div>
                  <div class = "indent">
                    <div class = "half-line-spacing">
                      I noticed that <span class="highlight" id = "lending">I had to balance customability and presets to accomodate all kinds of users.</span> Because our research showed that many people naturally talked about people in terms of four main groups
                      (family, friends, acquaintances, and strangers), I decided to build those four presets into the app. This is especially useful for users who don’t want to spend much time on customizations and just want general functionalities to protect their device.
                      Rather than just limiting it to just four presets, I thought to allow users to add their own preset for power users who enjoy customizing every little detail.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <div class = "bar-section-title"><span class = "semibold">Launching</span></div>
                  <div class = "indent">
                    <div class = "half-line-spacing">
                      I also came up with multiple ideas of how to launch the modes. This included using the fingerprint scanner that my research team and I had originally thought of, but also included potentially using a smartwatch or phones’ pulldown settings menu.
                      Ultimately, I decided to include all three as ways to launch modes. <span class="highlight" id = "lending">This decision was driven by trying to make the app accessible to a range of smartphone users such as those who might have a broken fingerprint
                        scanner or those who have a phone without a fingerprint scanner at all.</span>

                      <div class = "half-line-spacing">
                        While I was thinking about how a user could customize a preset for a certain lending situation, I realized that <span class="highlight" id = "lending">granting access to an app is as important as restricting access.</span>

                        <br>
                        This kind of interaction is rather awkward. More importantly, it defeats the purpose of a security app as the borrower is now holding a completely unlocked phone and has access to everything. I needed a way to allow for granting access
                        after the preset mode had been launched. I decided that this could be accomplished through a quick access feature where people can add apps they may want to change access to depending on the situation. Though optional, this feature would
                        be most beneficial with a secondary device like a a smartwatch where the lender could quickly scroll through their quick access app list.

                  Even with the research distilled into three main components, it was still hard for me to visualize how this app would function in action during a lending situation. So, being a very visual person, I created a user flow to see all the paths that a lending
                  situation could take. This flow was really helpful in helped me keep the big picture in mind and make sure that what I was making would fit well into this flow.

                  All that work finally brought me to the UI. I knew what features I wanted to include, so I started thinking about the flow between screens. Because my goal was to make the interactionswith the app
                  <span class = "semibold">simple</span> and <span class = "semibold">intuitive,</span> <span class="highlight" id = "lending">I focused on making sure that the navigation really clear</span> and that the app didn’t have much of a learning curve to it.

                  Sketching helped me to think through the app on paper. Once I had a good idea of the basic flow and elements, I moved to Figma for grayscales as I tried out different layouts.

                  Each iteration informed the next to get me to the final hi-fi mockups. As I iterated, I prioritized a simplicity&mdash;both visually and navigationally.

                    This project made me really think about how to design human interactions that are facilitated by technology. I learned a lot about people's relationship with their devices and with each other.
                    This was also my first design project that had hardware integrations. <span class = "semibold"><span class="highlight" id = "lending">Needing to consider how hardware like smartwatches and smartphones
                      fit into a phone-lending situation made me really focus on designing the interaction between the lender and the borrower rather than on the interface of the app itself.</span></span>
