    <center>Smartphone Lending is a research project centered around exploring how people share technology.
      We focused on a pain point within that experience where people are uncomfortable with letting another
      person borrow their phone. So, we prototyped an app that facilitated an easier phone lending/borrowing
      interaction, so that lenders are more comfortable with their device in someone else's hands.

        <br>
        In the current state of smartphone usage, most people are either unwilling or uncomfortable handing their device over to someone who asks to borrow it.
        Since people are generally nice, they allow others to borrow their phone even though they are worried about others seeing sensitive content.

          <h4>Lending habits by group</h4>
          During the interviews, we asked participants about their experiences with lending their phone.
          The graphs are a synthesis of the habits that they mentioned.
          Because we did not prompt participants about any specific groups, participants
          generated categories of people themselves. However, some participants did not mention
          some of the categories (marked in gray).

            <h4>Concerns about phone lending</h4>
            We asked the participants about the reasons why they woud not lend their phones. We did not prompt the participants, so all of these
            reasons were generated by the participants. But, there may be more concerns that participants
            may not have thought of or may not have told us. Regardless, this list indicates the concerns that were at the front of their minds.

                <span style="color: #77A88B"><h4>The top concern was someone seeing text messages.</h4></span>
                Interestingly, lenders were most concerned about the privacy of their contacts. People were worried about
                a borrower seeing a sensitive text chain as it compromises the privacy of the person at the other end of the texts.
                <h4><SUP>&nbsp;</SUP></h4>
                <span style="color: #77A88B"><h4>Theft was the second-most prominent concern.</h4></span>
                This concern typically only applied to strangers. Several participants also said that they were likely to judge a borrower's
                appearance and intentions to determine trustworthiness before lending their phone.

            their typically unlocking method such as fingerprint, faceID, or password.</span></h4>

              <h4><b>Presets</b></h4>
              <br>
              In our research, we found that people typically categorized borrowers into four categories. Because
              these categories were the same among most people, we decided to make them into existing presets.
              <br><br>
              <b><span style="color: #77A88B">The app comes preloaded with the four preset modes:</span></b>

                4. Strangers<br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Users have the ability to modify these presets according to their own preferences. They can also add their
              own preset mode. By default, the family preset is the least restrictive while the strangers preset is the most
              restrictive.

                    <br><br>
                    This kind of interaction is awkward and uncomfortable. Most importantly though, it becomes unsafe. If the lender decides
                    to trust the borrower, the borrower gets a completely unlocked phone and can now access everything. To target this issue,
                    we needed a way to grant access to a specific app, so that users do not have to exit our app completely which defeats the
                    purpose of a security app.
                    <br><br>
                    So, we added a quick access feature where people can add any apps they may want to grant access to depending on a situation.
                    This feature is most beneficial on a smartwatch as lenders can quickly scroll through their quick access app list.

                    <b><span style="color: #77A88B">Because the methods of launching are discreet, most of the time, borrowers wouldn't even know that they have restricted access. </b></span>
                    They would likely think that there is really a network connection error or that the lender just does not have a certain app installed.
                    <br><br>Further, our research showed that
                    people only ask to borrow a phone when they are really in need. Therefore, <b><span style="color: #77A88B">their
                      need for a phone would generally outweigh any offense they might take </b></span>from the lender appearing to not trust them by restricting access.

                      <h4><b>What happens when people learn the "tricks" of launching the modes?</b></h4>
                      Even if people learned the common features of the app and knew they had restricted access, <b><span style="color: #77A88B">the lender could reframe the interaction to ensure that there is no awkwardness.</b></span>
                      Instead of framing the interaction as one of distrust, the lender could easily explain that they use one mode when lending to anyone regardless of it that is true or not.

                      <b><span style="color: #77A88B">Another big reason people don’t lend their phones is due to concerns of theft. </b></span>
                      Our “other security” section targets this concern.
                      <br><br>
                      <h4><b>Anti-theft</b></h4>
                      If the phone is on a mode with anti-theft enabled, <b><span style="color: #77A88B">the phone’s accelerometer turns on once that mode launches.</b></span>
                      It can be customized to run actions like blaring an alarm and locking the sim card tray so the phone remains traceable. When the phone's accelerometer detects running, these actions launch.
                      <br><br>
                      <h4><b>Anti-pickpocket</b></h4>
                      If the phone is on a mode with anti-pickpocket enabled, the phone "locks" in this mode. The phone will not turn on or function at all until the phone owner normally unlocks their phone. Since many pickpockets are discreet and slip away, using the accelerometer is not effective. Instead, a phone on this mode
                      <b><span style="color: #77A88B">can be paired with any secondary device that has a bluetooth connection</b></span> (like a smartwatch or wireless earbuds). If a phone leaves a certain range with the secondary device, it can initiate a series of actions like
                      sounding an alarm and locking the sim card tray.

                        prototyping an app like this, I was able to really focus in on a specific type of user and how to improve their experiences with each other that are facilitated by technology.
