    I discovered the world of UX design in my sophomore year at Dartmouth College.
    Since then,I have been intrigued and inspired by design
    <br>and its ability to impact the world.
    I am currently a junior
    studying <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>Cognitive Science</b></span>
    with a focus in <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>Human-Computer Interaction</b></span>
    <br>and minoring in <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>Human-Centered Design.</b></span>
    </p>

    I was born in Singapore and raised in Rhode Island, so I am super lucky to have been exposed to a ton of new things. Consequently, I have
    <br>found a love of exploring that manifests itself in everything I do&mdash;from
    my love of travelling to my love of picking up new skills and hobbies.
    <br>I am most recently an avid bullet journaler, fountain pen user, tech enthusiast, and tea lover.

    I would love to connect!
