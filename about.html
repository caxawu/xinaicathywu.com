    I discovered the world of UX design in my sophomore year at Dartmouth College.
    Since then, I have been intrigued and inspired by design and its ability to impact the world.
    I am currently a junior
    studying <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>Cognitive Science</b></span>
    with a focus in <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>Human-Computer Interaction</b></span>
    and minoring in <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>Human-Centered Design.</b></span>

    I was born in Singapore and raised in Rhode Island, so I am super lucky to have been exposed to plenty of new things.
    Consequently, I have found a love of exploring. It manifests itself in everything from
    my love for travelling to my love of picking up new skills and hobbies. I am most recently
    an avid bullet journaler, fountain pen user, tech enthusiast, and tea lover.
