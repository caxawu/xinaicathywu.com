    <center>Spot-the-Difference is a reimagination of the classic game in VR. Bringing it to a 3D space allows us to
      take advantage of the exploratory nature of the game as players can walk around
      two scenes and discover different elements.

        Work in a team of two to create any VR experience that is something meaningful,
        informative, beautiful, or all three. Try to not have the three dimensional spatial aspect
        of VR be an irrelevant gimmick but rather something more intrinsic where the overall user experience is delightful.

        Because there were so many directions we could take this project, my partner and I first thought of ways in which VR could

                This project was a lot of fun to work on. I was able to experiment with how to use a 3-dimensional space in
                a productive way which allowed me to really appreciate what an extra dimension could add to an experience.
                I also found that an experience can still be very immersive even with a rather simplistic aesthetic like low-poly.
