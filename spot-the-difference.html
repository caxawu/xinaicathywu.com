              I pulled my 3D models into Unity to create a cohesive nature-y environment that looked appealing and fun to be in. I also animated most of the assets and added sound to the environment to make it even more immersive.

        <div class = "rightContent">
          The assignment tasked us with creating any VR experience that is meaningful,
          informative, beautiful, or all three. We were guided by the mission of trying not have the three dimensional spatial aspect
          of VR be an irrelevant gimmick but rather something more intrinsic where the overall user experience is delightful.

        <div class = "rightContent">
          Because there were so many directions we could take this project, my partner and I first thought of ways in which VR could
          add to an experience. We wanted to take full advantage of the immersiveness and the access to a third dimension in VR.
          <br><br>
          When considering games for inspiration, we found our way to spot-the-difference games. Most notably, these games are incredibly simple, but <span class="highlight" id = "spot">they have always been static and 2D.
            So, we thought to reimagining it into an animated 3D one where the player could be dropped into the world and actually walk around and explore the environment.</span>
