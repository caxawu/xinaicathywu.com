        Tarsier Goggles is an educational tool for students to learn interactively in the classroom. It enables users to experience the world from the perspective of a tarsier and
        focuses on the visual system&mdash;allowing students to see and learn firsthand the differences between animal visions.

          They are nocturnal, dichromatic (red-green colorblind) and carnivorous. What makes them special is that they
          have the largest eyes-to-body ratio out of all mammals. Their brain-sized eyes maximizes
          their ability to see in low-light to better hunt prey.

          primarily for students, but also for anyone interested in learning about how different animals see. As a member of
          the DALI lab, we partnered with the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning
          (DCAL) and two biology professors. This project has been in the works for a few terms, but our main goal was
          to bring this project to Dartmouth classrooms and labs.

          Tarsier Goggles was designed for students in Dartmouth’s Biology 14 class set to run next term. However, multiple departments across campus,
          from the Anthropology department to the Dartmouth medical school to even an English class, are
          interested in incorporating this project into their courses.

          The user can also better understand how tarsiers look around. (Since their eyes are so big, their eyes can't rotate so they move their whole head instead.)
          To simulate this, tarsier vision appears blurry until the user moves their head to a specific object and that sole object comes into focus.

          We found that first-time users of VR especially relied heavily on us guiding them through the experience despite there being an in-app tutorial. So, we redesigned the tutorial panel multiple times so that the wording was clear and was as helpful as possible.

            <br><b><span style="color: #7D8DB9">We found that even though we had a tutorial, people were not reading it</span></b> because
            the colors made it hard to read and the words were just slightly too close to their headset. So, we did a lot of iterating on the tutorial to maximize
            its usefulness.
            <br><b><span style="color: #7D8DB9">Another challenge was optimization.</span></b> Because the Oculus Quest has less processing power than the HTC Vive, we had to
            redesign all the scenes and incorporate all the new functions without lag. We spent a lot of time reducing poly counts of our 3D models, simplifying
            all the scenes, and editing lighting. While these definitely helped, we had to keep this limitation in mind throughout every step of the process.
