        ARTrek is a cross-platform augmented-reality mobile indoor navigation app. The app has two sections. As a finder, the user inputs their destination and
        follows the AR path markers that appear. As a forger, that same user can mark a path for others to use.

          <b>1.</b> As a student who has taken a couple classes in our Thayer School of Engineering, <span style="color: #015E31"><b>I still get lost in the building sometimes.</b></span>
          Between the strange layout of the building that is actually comprised of two buildings and the interesting placement of auditoriums
          in both the basement and the second floor, <span style="color: #015E31"><b>the maps on the walls are, needless to say, not very helpful.</b></span>
          <br><br>
          <b>2.</b> I was lucky enough to study abroad last year in France and travel a bit. One thing I found amazing was how accurate the trains were in Switzerland.
          They arrived and left exactly on the minute. But because of this, <span style="color: #015E31"><b>the time between transferring trains was really short</b></span> (like 3 minutes). Track numbers
          were clearly displayed, but getting to that track was another story&mdash;<span style="color: #015E31"><b>especially when I only had 3 minutes to navigate a crowded and unfamiliar location.</b></span>
          <br><br>
          <b>3.</b> Have you ever gotten an email with picture attachment of a building map with a line badly drawn in to show how to get from point A (usually the front door)
          to point B (the event location)? Similarly, have you ever gotten a text message from someone detailing exactly how to get to where they are?
          <span style="color: #015E31"><b>When getting somewhere is confusing enough to need such an email or text, the email or text doesn't do much more to help.</b></span>

            Though there are many applicable situations, we decided to focus in on navigating indoor spaces. Since HackDartmouth was held in the Thayer School of Engineering (a really confusing building), it was
            the perfect use case.
            <br><br>
            The problem lies in the fact that certain buildings are difficult to navigate, some rooms are hard to find, and maps are also not always
            helpful or accessible.

            <br>
            My brother and I have always been fascinated by AR and all that it can do. In the Spring term when HackDartmouth took place, I was also in an
            AR/VR class. My class was about halfway though the AR section of the class, so I already knew a bit about Unity and setting up AR image targets.
            We were also both comfortable with coding in Java and wanted to play to our strengths.

              <h4><b> Forger </b></h4>
              On the forger side, users who are familiar with a location can place path markers to help others. Existing digital maps rely on premapping
              all existing streets and roads, so that it can suggest paths to users. This process is not feasible for mapping every building. So,
              we used a "Waze-like" approach where users can contribute to a network of defined paths.
              <span style="color: #015E31"><b>By making the data user-driven, more buildings can be mapped&mdash;allowing

                  Though we focused our user group on people navigating a confusing building, our solution also targets the other pain points we identified.
                  <br><br>
                  <h4><b> Personalized Paths </b></h4>
                  Because users can contribute paths anyways, <b><span style="color: #015E31">being able to send a specific path to a specific person could
                    come in handy.</b></span> This could be used to show a friend/delivery person how to get from the front of an apartment complex to a specific door, since following a path on a phone
                    is much simplier than trying to decipher a message specifying the steps. This also allows people to meet up more easily in hard-to-find/less-travelled locations.
                    <br><br>
                    <h4><b> Quick Updating </b></h4>
                    User-driven data also allows paths to be updated quickly. <b><span style="color: #015E31">In the face of construction in front of someone's house, or a last-minute room change, this feature is really helpful. </b></span>
                    As long as one person maps the path, everyone else can easily follow it around the construction/to the right room.

                    We ran into a lot of version incompatibilities between ARCore, Android Studio, and Unity. A good portion of the time was dedicated to re-downloaded different versions
                    to try to get everything to connect. My brother and I also had to learn how to use ARCore to recognize a location instead of a still image. We also had to find a way to save
                    this path information. Luckily, with the help of the Microsoft reps at the event, we found that Microsoft's Azure Cloud Anchors provided exactly what we needed. The software
                    also provided example code of how these anchors worked. We spent a lot of time looking through the code, and ultimately modifying it to build our project.

                    I definitely had a great time at HackDartmouth. This was my first time dealing with smartphone coding and I'm glad that I had a chance to explore it a bit. I also learned a lot
                    about how different softwares talk to each other and how clouds connect to local devices. Working with AR gave me a better understanding of
                    the impact of this kind of technology. Another takeaway was that new technologies like AR requires a different kind of user interface since it is both on the phone screen and in the real world.
