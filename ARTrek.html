        <br><h3><b>The problem</b></h3>
        As a student who has taken a couple classes in our Thayer School of Engineering, I still get lost in the building sometimes. Between the strange layout of this building that is actually comprised of two buildings and the interesting placement of auditoriums in both the basement and the second floor, the maps on the walls are, needless to say, not very helpful.
        <br>Digital maps today though, have gotten pretty good. If they can help someone navigate to basicially anywhere on the street, why canâ€™t the same type of system exist for indoor destinations?
        <span style="color: #148f9f"><b>The problem lies in the fact that certain buildings are difficult to navigate, some rooms are hard to find, and maps of buildings are also not always accessible.</span></b>
        <br>
        <br><h3><b>The user</b></h3>
        People who need to navigate a large, confusing (and often unfamiliar) building in order to get to their destination.
        <br>
        <br><h3><b>Our answer</b></h3>
        ARTrek is an augmented-reality smartphone app where users can input their target location and follow the AR path markers to get to their destination.
        <br>
        <br><h3><b>The details</b></h3>
        Our app consists of two elements: Finder and Forger. On the finder side, users simply follow the path markers to get to a location. On the forger side, users who are familiar with a location can place path markers to help others. Existing digital maps rely on premapping all existing streets and roads so that it can suggest paths to users. This same process is not feasible for mapping every building. But, by allowing users to contribute to a network of defined paths. By making the data user-driven, more paths become available in more buildings. To maintain the reliability of the system, a path is only verified and uploaded for all users to see after multiple people have marked the same path to a destination.

      <h3><b>Bonus</b></h3>
      User-driven data creates a substantial database that can be expanded to any locations that traditional maps do not cover. This can include anything from navigating from the front of an apartment complex to a specific apartment to walking to a specific location in a park. Because the app depends on user contribution, paths can also be updated quickly in the event of construction or road closures. The nature of this app lends intself to allowing users to send custom directions. This feature allows people to meet up more easily or navigate more easily to a hard-to-find/less-travelled location.
