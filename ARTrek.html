      ARTrek is a cross-platform augmented-reality mobile indoor navigation app. The app has two sections. As a finder, the user inputs their destination and
      follows the AR path markers that appear. As a forger, that same user can mark a path for others to use.

        <b>1.</b> As a student who has taken a couple classes in our Thayer School of Engineering, <span style="color: #015E31"><b>I still get lost in the building sometimes.</b></span>
        Between the strange layout of the building that is actually comprised of two buildings and the interesting placement of auditoriums
        in both the basement and the second floor, <span style="color: #015E31"><b>the maps on the walls are, needless to say, not very helpful.</b></span>
        <br><br>
        <b>2.</b> I was lucky enough to study abroad last year in France and travel a bit. One thing I found amazing in Switzerland was how accurate the trains were.
        They arrived and left exactly on the minute. But because of this, <span style="color: #015E31"><b>the time between transferring trains was really short</b></span> (like 3 minutes). Track numbers
        were clearly displayed, but getting to that track was another story&mdash;<span style="color: #015E31"><b>especially when I only had 3 minutes to navigate a crowded and unfamiliar location.</b></span>
        <br><br>
        <b>3.</b> Have you ever gotten an email with picture attachment of a building map with a line badly drawn in to show how to get from point A (usually the front door)
        to point B (the event location)? Similarly, have you ever gotten a text message from someone detailing exactly how to get to where they are? My brother and I
        have experienced this just like everyone else.
        <span style="color: #015E31"><b>When getting somewhere is confusing enough to need such an email or text, the email or text doesn't do much more to help.</b></span>

        <div class = "right-two-third">
          <br>
          Though there are many applicable situations, we decided to focus in on navigating indoor spaces. Since HackDartmouth was held in the Thayer School of Engineering (a really confusing building), it was
          the perfect use case.
          <br><br>
          The problem lies in the fact that certain buildings are difficult to navigate, some rooms are hard to find, and maps are also not always
          helpful or accessible.

          <br>
          My brother and I have always been fascinated by AR and all that it can do. In the Spring term when HackDartmouth took place, I was also in an
          AR/VR class. My class was about halfway though the AR section of the class, so I already knew a bit about Unity and setting up AR image targets.
          We were also both comfortable with coding in Java and wanted to play to our strengths.

            <h4><b> Forger </b></h4>
            On the forger side, users who are familiar with a location can place path markers to help others. Existing digital maps rely on premapping
            all existing streets and roads so that it can suggest paths to users. This process is not feasible for mapping every building. So,
            we used a "Waze-like" approach where users can contribute to a network of defined paths.

                Though we focused our user group on people navigating a confusing building, our solution also targets the other pain points we identified.
                <br><br>
                <h4><b> Personalized Paths </b></h4>
                Because uses can contribute paths anyways, <b><span style="color: #015E31">being able to send a specific path to a specific person could
                  comes in handy.</b></span> This could be used to show a friend/delivery person how to get from the front of an apartment complex to a specific door since following a path on a phone
                  is much simplier than trying to decipher a message specifying the steps. This also allows helps people to meet up more easily in hard-to-find/less-travelled locations.
                  <br><br>
                  <h4><b> Quick Updating </b></h4>
                  User-driven data also allows paths to be updated quickly. <b><span style="color: #015E31">In the face of construction in front of someone's house, or a last-minute room change, this feature is really helpful. </b></span>

                  We ran into a lot of version incompatibilities between ARCore, Android Studio, and Unity. A good portion of the time was dedicated to redownloaded different versions
                  to try to get everything to connect. My brother and I also had to learn how to use ARCore to recognize a location instead of a still image. We also had to find a way to save
                  this path information. Luckily, with the help of the Microsoft reps at the event, we found that Microsoft's Azure Cloud Anchors provided exactly what we needed. The software
                  also provided example code of how these anchors worked. We spent a lot of time looking through the code, and ultimately modifying it to build our project.

                  I definitely had a great time at HackDartmouth. This was my first time dealing with smartphone coding and I'm glad that I had a chance to explore it a bit. I also learned a lot
                  about how different softwares talk to each other and how clouds connect to local devices. Working with AR gave me a better understanding of
                  the impact of this kind of technology. Another takeaway was that new technologies like AR requires a different kind of interface since it is both on the phone screen and in the real world.
                  <br><br>
                  Since this was my first time participating in hackathon, I also learned about how much can happen in the span of 24 hours. I were able to attend workshops, talk to other teams, and work on our project. While the projects were the main
                  focus, I had a great time seeing what other teams were up to and talking to the organizers and sponsers, and going to every workshop I could.
