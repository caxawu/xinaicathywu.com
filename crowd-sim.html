    <center>VR Crowd Sim is an app that allows people to practice speaking in front of a virtual audience in order to overcome stage fright.
      The audience murmurs to each other before the player steps on stage and begins to quiet down in response to audio picked up by the headset.

        Work in a team of two to create any XR experience that is something meaningful,
        informative, beautiful, or all three. Try to not have the three dimensional spatial aspect
        of XR be an irrelevant gimmick but rather something more intrinsic where the overall user experience is delightful.

        <h3><SUP>&nbsp;</SUP>The inspiration</h3>
      </div>
      <div class = "right-two-third">
        Because this project was so open-ended, my partner and I first focused on things we both enjoyed. <span style="color: #853129"><b>We settled on music, and from there, brainstormed ideas where a
          3D space would add to an experience.</span></b>We started thinking of ways music was limited in the real-world. We identified that many musicians perform in unfamiliar venues and in front
          of large audiences, yet many practice alone in comfortable environments.
          <br><br><br>
          <h4><span style="color: #853129"> We realized that this disparity between practice settings and performance settings leads to stage fright and anxiousness when performing.</span></h4>

        </div>
        <div class = "right-two-third">
          <br>
          Though we started with the idea of improving the musicians' experiences of performing, <span style="color: #853129"><b>we realized that problem we were really targeting was overcoming stage fright.</b></span>
          Instead of building something that would be just for musicians, we envisioned how we could help anyone who needs to get up on a stage, but has stage fright.

              <b><span style="color: #853129">We modelled almost all of the art assets used in the app. </span></b>We also animated multiple resting animations for the audience like breathing, turning, and repositioning hands. Transitioning between
              these animations made movements a bit more organic as each person animated independently from the rest of the audience. We also created walking animations that had a small
              probability of being triggered for each person in the audience. When triggered, the person would get up from their seat and walk to the nearest exit.

              <h4><b> For Speakers </b></h4>
              To allow speakers to practice their speech, we want to add a feature where our app can <b><span style="color: #853129">connect to Google Drive where the user can display
                their presentation on the screen behind them.</span></b> This way, they can practice more realistically in front of an audience.

                <h4><b> For Musicians </b></h4>
                We want to add a feature for musicians where they can <b><span style="color: #853129">upload their sheet music and it will appear on the podium/stand on stage.</span></b> Having this feature
                allows musicians (who don't need to look at their hands when playing) to practice in front of our virtual crowd. Another beneficial addition would be
                to <b><span style="color: #853129">model different locations from a school auditorium to Carnegie Hall.</span></b> This would allow the musician to slowly work their way up to larger audiences
                in more stressful performance halls.

                <br>
                <span style="color: #853129"><b>The biggest challenge we faced was balancing how realistic we could make our app and how much the Oculus Go could handle.</b></span>
                Because we had so many chair models, people models, and lighting effects, the headset became rather laggy. To fix this issue, we had to simplify all of the models and fill only
                about 10% of the seats with people. Because the user can't move off the stage, we used lighting to hide some of the lower resolution models in the back of the auditorium.
                We also had to reduce our lighting effects like
                lens flares that would have simulated a spotlight-type glare from the stage.
                <br><br>
                Another challenge was making the people look realistic. We worked with four pre-made human models, and tried to vary their appearances by editing materials in Photoshop.
                However, we soon realized that drastically different clothing colors make it easier to pinpoint which models were the same in the audience. Rather than create a new materal
                for each person, we kept the default ones and made subtle changes to the shades of their clothing. <span style="color: #853129"><b>The other challenge was animating the people.</span></b>
                We prevented their movements from being
                in sync with each other by creating multiple resting animations and using code to transition between random animations for each person.
