      <b>ARTrek</b>
      <br> Our HackDartmouth winning project that proposes a "Waze" app for indoor navigation.
      <br>On one end, users follow augmented reality breadcrumb-like path markers to their destination. On the other, the same users can contribute paths they know well to the database to help other users.
      <br><br>User-driven data allows paths to be updated quickly in the face of construction or road closures. Users can also create and send custom paths to specific users&mdash;helpful in cases where someone could send custom directions to their house if it was difficult to navigate or surrounded by construction.
      <br>

      <b>DartTree</b>
      <br> A redesign of the Dartmouth Alumni Network to better support students seeking "off the beaten path" careers. We aimed to increase accessibility and decreasing intimidation in regards to reaching out to alumni. Our redesign personalizes interactions as it fosters connections based on shared interests rather than just career aspirations.
      <br>
