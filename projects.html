      <b>ARTrek</b>
      <br> Our 1st place project from HackDartmouth proposing a "Waze" app for indoor navigation. On the Finder side, users input their destination and follow the augmented-reality path markers to their destination. On the Forger side, the same users can contribute paths to the database stored in the cloud. If multiple users submit the same path to a destination, the path is verified and added.
      <br><br>User-driven data not only creates a substantial database, but also allows paths to be updated quickly in the event of construction and road closures. Users can also create and send custom paths to specific users. This could be used in many ways such as the user sending custom directions to a friend if the userâ€™s house was difficult to find.

      <b>Smartphone Lending Project (On-going)</b>
      <br> Our research team in Professor Yang's HCI lab is working on facilitating easier and more comfortable interactions with between people sharing technology. We are in the process of prototyping a smartphone security app that allows someone to stealthily change access settings on his or her phone before letting someone borrow it.
      <br>

      <b>VR Crowd Simulation</b>
      <br> A VR app to practice public speaking and to confront stage fright. When you first put on the headset, you find yourself offstage in an auditorium. On click, you walk onstage to the podium. The audience will be murmuring and talking amongst themselves but will quiet down you start speaking. To simulate a real audience, they shift in their seats, and will walk out of the auditorium as well.

      <b>Spot the Difference</b>
      <br> A VR game design to be an immersive take on the classic spot-the-difference games. In the actual scene, walk around and observe. Then, head to the differences scene and see if you can spot the extra elements. With swaying trees, chirping birds, and a hot air balloon, almost every element animates and creates a fun and peaceful environment.

      <b>DartTree</b>
      <br> A redesign of the Dartmouth Alumni Network to better support students seeking "off the beaten path" careers. We aimed to increase accessibility and decreasing intimidation in regard to reaching out to alumni. Our redesign personalizes interactions as it fosters connections based on shared interests rather than just career aspirations.
